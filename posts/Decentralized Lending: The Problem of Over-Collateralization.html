        <h1>Decentralized Lending: The Problem of Over-Collateralization</h1>

        <h2>The Promise of DeFi</h2>
        <p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as one of the most disruptive forces in financial services. Protocols like AAVE, Compound, and MakerDAO (now SKY) allow users to lend and borrow crypto-assets in a transparent, non-custodial environment. By replacing intermediaries with smart contracts, DeFi promised to democratize access to credit and investment opportunities worldwide.</p>

        <h2>The Collateral Trap</h2>
        <p>Yet despite its openness, DeFi lending is built almost entirely on <strong>overcollateralization</strong>. This means that in order to borrow $100, a user typically needs to lock up $150–200 in collateral. While this design effectively mitigates default risk, it introduces a structural flaw: only those who already have significantly more assets than they are trying to borrow can access credit. For people with limited savings or income, precisely those who need credit the most, this model results exclusionary.</p>
        <p>The scale of the problem of financial inclusion is enormous. According to the <em>World Bank’s Global Findex Database (2021)</em>, 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked, lacking access to formal financial services including credit. For these individuals, credit is not just about consumption, it is often represents the key to investing in education, health, or even entrepreneurial activity.</p>

        <h2>Why DeFi Relies on Over-Collateralization</h2>
        <p>This reliance is not arbitrary. It arises from two fundamental constraints:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Information asymmetry:</strong> Unlike banks, DeFi protocols cannot verify income statements, employment history, or repayment behavior. Borrowers appear only as pseudonymous wallet addresses, leaving smart contracts with no way to assess intent or ability to repay. The only reliable signal available a borrower can supply is the collateral locked on-chain.</li>
          <li><strong>Volatility of crypto assets:</strong> In order to protect lenders, protocols enforce automatic liquidations when collateral value (denominated in a certain crypto asset) falls below a certain threshold. This rigid mechanism ensures solvency but forces borrowers to maintain a wide safety buffer to not be liquidated, further limiting how much they can borrow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Cost of Safety</h2>
        <p>Research from the <em>Bank for International Settlements (2023)</em> shows that even though protocols theoretically allow users to borrow up to 70–80% of collateral value, borrowers rarely approach these limits. Instead, most maintain leverage ratios between 1.4 and 1.9, well below the maximum. The reason is simple: even small market dips can trigger liquidations, leading to capital loss and reinforcing systemic fragility.</p>
        <p>This creates a paradox. DeFi offers permissionless access to credit, but in practice only benefits those with substantial crypto holdings who can afford to lock up capital inefficiently. The very users most in need of credit, those with stable income, responsible financial behavior, but limited assets or in an illiquid situation, are shut out.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The structural dependence on overcollateralization reveals a critical limitation in today’s DeFi: its inability to extend credit to users without significant crypto wealth, hampering financial inclusion. In my personal view, DeFi has the potential to play a substantial role in fostering economic development and improving capital allocation, especially in regions with extreme financial restrictions and where traditional financial services are not available. However, in order to achieve this, it needs to find a way to assess creditworthiness beyond collateral without compromising the core values of privacy and decentralization.</p>
