             MORPHO
        ========================== -->
        <h2>Morpho: Architecture & Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Morpho’s mission is to make on-chain lending <strong>more capital-efficient</strong> while preserving the security model users already trust.
          It began as the <em>Morpho Optimizer</em>, a matching layer on top of Aave/Compound, and later evolved into <em>Morpho Blue</em> and
          <em>MetaMorpho (Vaults)</em> to deliver isolated-market safety with curated allocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morpho was built to solve the capital-inefficiency problem in classic pooled lending models like Aave or Compound. In those protocols,
          lenders earn the pool supply APY (often lower than what a matched borrower would pay) and borrowers pay the pool borrow APY (often higher
          than what a matched lender would accept). The spread keeps pools liquid and funds the protocol treasury. Morpho aims to reduce that spread
          without compromising safety.
        </p>

        <h3>Morpho Optimizer (v1): Matching on top of Aave / Compound</h3>
        <p>
          The core idea is to leverage Aave/Compound as the risk and settlement layer, and add a <strong>P2P matching engine</strong> on top.
          This reduces the interest-rate spread by matching lenders and borrowers closer to a midpoint. For example, if a borrower wants to pay 5%
          and a lender is happy receiving 3%, Morpho matches them at ~4%. If a match isn’t available, positions sit in the pool at the usual rates,
          ensuring no one ends up worse than baseline.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Users interact only with Morpho contracts.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Oracles, collateral, liquidations, and leverage still rely on the underlying Aave/Compound architecture. Matched positions remain fully secured by the base protocol.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This worked because it represented a <strong>Pareto improvement</strong>, every user ended up in a better position. It also reduced idle liquidity as positions shifted toward matched pairs.
          But matching on top of a shared pool inherits pool parameters and risks. Morpho couldn’t choose its own LTVs, asset listings, interest-rate curves, or oracle systems; and that limited product
          design paved the way for <strong>Morpho Blue</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Morpho Blue (v2): Isolated lending markets</h3>
        <p>
          Morpho Blue builds its own market layer and lending infrastructure. Each market is isolated in its own capsule with independent parameters.
          Every Morpho Blue market defines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collateral asset:</strong> the token users post to borrow.</li>
          <li><strong>Loan asset:</strong> the token users borrow.</li>
          <li><strong>Oracle:</strong> the specific price feed used for that pair.</li>
          <li><strong>LLTV (Liquidation Loan-to-Value):</strong> the maximum borrowed-value-to-collateral-value ratio allowed before liquidation.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquidation module:</strong> custom logic defining how liquidations happen and what the penalty is.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the ETH/USDC pair can have different parameters than stETH/DAI. Morpho Blue also implements its own interest-rate model
          (utilization curves are coded per market), liquidation logic, and risk framework.
        </p>

        <h4>The power and the limits of isolation</h4>
        <p>
          By isolating each pair into its own pool, Morpho diversifies risk: a risky asset in one market does not affect others. Borrowers gain access
          to new forms of collateral as long as someone deploys a market for it, there is no global listing vote required. Lenders can choose their preferred risk,
          ranging from exotic pairs to established ones. In that sense, Morpho Blue democratized access to credit and yield across a wide range of assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, offering dozens of isolated markets can overwhelm users. Lenders need to research each market’s parameters and risks, effectively acting
          like portfolio managers. Most users don’t want to run a small credit fund every time they lend stablecoins. This friction led to the next iteration:
          <strong>MetaMorpho</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>MetaMorpho (Vaults): Vaults that allocate liquidity across Blue markets</h3>
        <p>
          MetaMorpho abstracts risk management and allocation away from the end user. Previously, depositors had to pick markets, study oracles and LLTVs,
          and rebalance manually. MetaMorpho introduced <strong>vaults</strong> that perform these tasks transparently and permissionlessly, think of them
          as portfolio managers for Morpho Blue.
        </p>

        <h4>How MetaMorpho works</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Owner:</strong> sets fees, appoints curators/allocators, and manages vault parameters.</li>
          <li><strong>Curator:</strong> defines which Morpho Blue markets the vault can use, they are the “risk brain” that adds/removes eligible pairs.</li>
          <li><strong>Allocator:</strong> executes allocation and rebalancing across eligible markets, maximizing APY per unit of risk within the curator’s guardrails.</li>
          <li><strong>Timelocks:</strong> critical parameter changes are delayed, giving users time to exit before exposure changes.</li>
          <li><strong>ERC-4626 standardization:</strong> deposits mint shares that represent a pro-rata claim on the vault’s assets.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 1: Deposit & Share Issuance</h4>
          <p>
            A lender deposits an asset (e.g., USDC) into a MetaMorpho vault. The vault mints <em>shares</em> in return
            (<code>Vault Shares = f(deposit amount / total assets)</code>). These shares represent the lender’s claim to the vault’s
            total holdings across all its Morpho Blue markets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 2: Allocation</h4>
          <p>The allocator evaluates eligible markets (as defined by the curator) that exhibit:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong borrow demand:</strong> high utilization with healthy collateralization.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust infrastructure:</strong> reliable oracles and liquidation mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable spreads:</strong> stable, attractive interest-rate differentials.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It then distributes liquidity across those markets—for example, 60% in ETH/USDC, 25% in WBTC/USDC, and 15% in stETH/USDC. Allocations
            can be dynamically adjusted, but only within the pre-approved markets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 3: Interest Accrual</h4>
          <p>
            Borrowers in the underlying markets pay interest into the Morpho Blue contracts. Each market tracks
            <em>total supplied liquidity</em>, <em>total borrowed liquidity</em>, and <em>utilization rate</em>—which together determine its interest-rate curve.
            The vault’s share of each market’s lender income aggregates into total holdings. As income accrues, the vault’s share price (assets per share)
            increases—that’s how yield reaches depositors.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 4: Withdrawal</h4>
          <p>
            When a user withdraws, the vault burns their shares and returns the assets. If utilization is high (tight liquidity), the allocator unwinds
            positions to meet withdrawals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Why this system is powerful</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> users can deposit into a vault with a known curator and policy instead of managing markets themselves.</li>
          <li><strong>Delegated risk management:</strong> curators can be professional risk assessors (e.g., Gauntlet, Chaos Labs, or DAOs). All changes are <em>timelocked</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquidity aggregation:</strong> vaults concentrate liquidity across active markets, improving depth and reducing fragmentation while preserving isolation.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency & permissionlessness:</strong> all roles, actions, and allocations are on-chain; anyone can deploy a vault under the same ERC-4626 standard.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Today, Morpho functions not just as a niche optimizer but as a full-stack lending infrastructure. The original Optimizer products are deprecated
          (front-end support ending in September 2025). Morpho Blue sits at the core of this stack; the protocol supports hundreds of isolated markets, and
          MetaMorpho vaults aggregate liquidity and simplify access for lenders—deploying capital across curated risk perimeters while leveraging Blue’s modular
          architecture. The result: markets where lenders earn better rates, borrowers access bespoke collateral/borrow pairs, and risks are compartmentalized
          per-market. In short, Morpho delivers both accessibility and infrastructure-grade flexibility—placing it among the most relevant protocols powering
          on-chain credit markets.
