        ========================== -->
        <h2>Morpho: Architecture & Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Morpho’s mission is to make on-chain lending <strong>more capital-efficient</strong> while preserving the security model users already trust.
          It began as the <em>Morpho Optimizer</em>, a matching layer on top of Aave/Compound, and later evolved into <em>Morpho Blue</em> and
          <em>MetaMorpho (Vaults)</em> to deliver isolated-market safety with curated allocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morpho was built to solve the capital-inefficiency problem in classic pooled lending models like Aave or Compound. In those protocols,
          lenders earn the pool supply APY (often lower than what a matched borrower would pay) and borrowers pay the pool borrow APY (often higher
          than what a matched lender would accept). In this way, the pool stays liquid and the protocol treasury makes profits on interest spread. Morpho aims 
          to reduce that spread without compromising safety.
        </p>

        <h3>Morpho Optimizer (v1): Matching on top of Aave / Compound</h3>
        <p>
          The core idea is to leverage Aave/Compound as the risk and settlement layer, and add a <strong>P2P matching engine</strong> on top. As a result, 
          the framework reduces significantly the interest-rate spread by matching lenders and borrowers closer to a midpoint. For example, if a borrower wants to pay 5%
          and a lender is happy receiving 3%, Morpho matches them at ~4%. However, if a match isn’t available, positions sit in the pool at the usual rates,
          ensuring no one ends up worse than baseline.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Users interact only with Morpho contracts.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Oracles, collateral, liquidations, and leverage still rely on the underlying Aave/Compound architecture. As it is build on those protocols, the matched positions remained fully secured by the base protocol.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This framework worked well because it meant a <strong>Pareto Improvement</strong> for every user, and it was able to reduce 
          idle liquidity in the pools, as positions shifted toward matched pairs. However, this framework found some limitations. The main one being that matching users on top of a shared pool is still
          constrained by the original pool parameters and risks it inherited from Aave/Compound. Morpho could not choose its own LTV, its own listable assets, interest rate curves or oracles, everything was determined and constrained by the base protocol.
          This limited growth and was what paved the way for <strong>Morpho Blue</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Morpho Blue (v2): Isolated lending markets</h3>
        <p>
          Morpho Blue builds its own market layer and lending infrastructure in a way that each market is isolated in its own capsule with independent parameters.
          Every pair of a Morpho Blue market defines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collateral Asset:</strong> The token users post to borrow.</li>
          <li><strong>Loan Asset:</strong> The token users borrow.</li>
          <li><strong>Oracle:</strong> The specific price feed used for that pair.</li>
          <li><strong>LLTV (Liquidation Loan to Value):</strong> The maximum ratio of borrowed value to collateral value allowed before liquidation.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquidation module:</strong> Custom logic that defines how liquidations happen and what the penalty is.</li>  
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the ETH/USDC pair can have different parameters than stETH/DAI. Morpho Blue also implements its own interest-rate model
          (utilization curves are coded per market), liquidation logic, and risk framework.
        </p>

        <h4>The power and the limits of isolation</h4>
        <p>
          By isolating each pair into its own pool, Morpho diversifies risk: a risky asset in one market does not affect others. Borrowers gain access
          to new forms of collateral as long as someone deploys a market for it, there is no global listing vote required. Lenders can choose their preferred risk,
          ranging from exotic pairs to established ones. In that sense, Morpho Blue democratized access to credit and yield across a wide range of assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, offering dozens of isolated markets can overwhelm users. Lenders need to research each market’s parameters and risks, effectively acting
          like portfolio managers. Most users don’t want to run a small credit fund every time they lend stablecoins, and explained why the need to develop the next iteration:
          <strong>MetaMorpho</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>MetaMorpho (Vaults): Vaults that allocate liquidity across Blue markets</h3>
        <p>
          MetaMorpho abstracts risk management and allocation away from the end user. Previously, depositors had to pick markets, study oracles and LLTVs,
          and rebalance manually. MetaMorpho introduced <strong>vaults</strong> that perform these tasks transparently and permissionlessly, you may think of them
          as portfolio managers for Morpho Blue.
        </p>

        <h4>How MetaMorpho works</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Sets fees, appoints curators/allocators, manages vault parameters. The owner is responsible for vault governance.</li>
          <li><strong>Curator:</strong> Defines which Morpho Blue markets the vault can use. Curators act as the "risk brain" of the vault.</li>
          <li><strong>Allocator:</strong> Executes allocation and rebalancing within curator-approved markets.</li>
          <li><strong>Timelocks:</strong> Critical parameter changes wait a set period before taking effect.</li>
          <li><strong>ERC-4626 standardization:</strong> Deposits mint shares representing a pro-rata claim on vault assets.</li>  
        </ul>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 1: Deposit & Share Issuance</h4>
          <p>
            A lender deposits an asset (e.g., USDC) into a MetaMorpho vault. The vault mints <em>shares</em> in return
            (<code>Vault Shares = f(deposit amount / total assets)</code>). These shares represent the lender’s claim to the vault’s
            total holdings across all its Morpho Blue markets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 2: Allocation</h4>
          <p>The allocator evaluates eligible markets (as defined by the curator) that exhibit:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong borrow demand:</strong> high utilization with healthy collateralization.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust infrastructure:</strong> reliable oracles and liquidation mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable spreads:</strong> stable, attractive interest-rate differentials.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It then distributes liquidity across those markets—for example, 60% in ETH/USDC, 25% in WBTC/USDC, and 15% in stETH/USDC. Allocations
            can be dynamically adjusted, but only within the pre-approved markets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 3: Interest Accrual</h4>
          <p>
            Borrowers in the underlying markets pay interest into the Morpho Blue contracts. Each market tracks
            <em>total supplied liquidity</em>, <em>total borrowed liquidity</em>, and <em>utilization rate</em>, which together determine its interest-rate curve.
            The vault’s share of each market’s lender income aggregates into total holdings. As income accrues, the vault’s share price (assets per share)
            increases, and that’s how yield reaches depositors.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h4>Step 4: Withdrawal</h4>
          <p>
            When a user withdraws, the vault burns their shares and returns the assets. If utilization is high (tight liquidity), the allocator unwinds
            positions to meet withdrawals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Why this system is powerful</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> users can deposit into a vault with a known curator and policy instead of managing markets themselves.</li>
          <li><strong>Delegated risk management:</strong> curators can be professional risk assessors; all changes are <em>timelocked</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquidity aggregation:</strong> vaults concentrate liquidity while preserving isolation.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency & permissionlessness:</strong> roles/actions/allocations are on-chain; anyone puede desplegar un vault ERC-4626.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Today, Morpho functions not just as a niche optimizer but as a full-stack lending infrastructure. The original Optimizer products are now deprecated (with front-end support ending in September 2025). Morpho Blue sits at the core of this stack: TVL stands around US $3.9 billion 
          (as of mid-2025, up ~38% year-to-date) and the protocol supports hundreds of isolated markets. Layered on top of that, MetaMorpho vaults aggregate liquidity and simplify access for lenders, enabling capital deployment across curated risk-perimeters while leveraging Blue’s modular 
          architecture. The result: markets where lenders earn better rates, borrowers access bespoke collateral/borrow pairs, and risks are compartmentalised per-market.
