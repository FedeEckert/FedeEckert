        <h1>How I Used Machine Learning to Predict Bitcoin Volatility</h1>
        <p class="section-lead">
          In this project, I set out to answer a simple question:
          can we build an index that captures the financial conditions around Bitcoin and use it to anticipate volatility?
        </p>

        <h2>Building the Dataset</h2>
        <p>
          The starting point for any attempt to measure financial conditions is the data. For crypto, that means blending two worlds:
          the traditional financial system and the blockchain-native one. To do this, I assembled a dataset with <strong>22 variables</strong>
          covering global markets, sentiment, and Bitcoin’s on-chain activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the traditional side, I pulled equity market proxies (S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, Russell 2000), commodities (gold, silver, oil),
          the US dollar index, Treasury yields, and the VIX (Volatility Index). Together, these track monetary policy, inflation hedging, and investor risk appetite.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the crypto side, I included Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, trading volumes, and intraday volatility. To capture fundamentals,
          I drew from Blockchain.com’s API: hash rate, mining difficulty, block size, transaction fees, and confirmation times. Finally,
          I added the widely followed Fear &amp; Greed Index as a proxy for investor sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were important <strong>limitations</strong>. Free APIs only allowed me to collect about two years of continuous data
          (Jan&nbsp;2023 to Mar&nbsp;2025). That short horizon means the models risk overfitting to one specific cycle rather than generalizing across regimes.
          It is one of the most important caveats when interpreting the results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before analysis, I applied several adjustments: all price series were converted into daily returns, skewed variables were log-transformed,
          weekends were dropped, and US market holidays were removed to match trading calendars. Finally, the data was standardized to make it comparable across variables.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h2>Using PCA to conform an Index</h2>
        <p>
          To simplify the complexity, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This method compresses the information into a handful of latent factors.
          The first six components explained around 70% of total variance, with the first component (PC1) dominated by crypto-native signals like BTC/ETH volumes,
          volatility, and hash rate. I chose the first 6 Principal components to represent the so called <strong>Financial Conditions Index (FCI)</strong> in order to predict the volatility of Bitcoin.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="../posts/Data/PCA.jpeg" alt="Scree plot showing explained variance across components">
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Scree plot: the first six components were retained, balancing explanatory power and parsimony.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Predicting volatility with machine learning</h2>
        <p>
          Next, I utilized supervised learning techniques in order to predict movements in BTC volatility. I defined high volatility as days where Bitcoin’s volatility exceeded its median,
          and trained three models: <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>, <strong>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</strong>, and <strong>Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)</strong>, 
          using the first six PCs as features (together they have 70% of explainatory power). You may see the result of this study on the ROC curves and confusion matrices below (to avoid leakage, the data split respected time order). 
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="../posts/Data/ROC.jpeg" alt="ROC curves for LR, LDA, QDA models">
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> ROC curves: all models delivered high AUCs (~0.90).</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="../posts/Data/Confusion-matrix.jpeg" alt="Confusion matrices of the models">
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Confusion matrices: different trade-offs between missing signals and false alarms.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Each model told a slightly different story. Logistic Regression caught nearly all high-volatility cases but produced more false alarms.
          QDA was more conservative, minimizing false positives but missing some events. LDA balanced the two. The ROC-AUC scores were around 0.90,
          suggesting strong predictive power.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is a catch, these near-perfect curves are likely an artifact of the dataset. With only two years of data, the models may be
          picking up on one particular market regime rather than true universal drivers. Non-stationary variables like hash rate and difficulty,
          which trend over time, can also inflate separability by acting as hidden time proxies. To harden the analysis, PCA should be fit only
          on the training set, walk-forward validation should be used, and longer histories incorporated if available.
        </p>

        

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Despite limitations, the experiment shows that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A crypto-specific FCI can summarize complex conditions into one metric.</li>
          <li>Machine learning models can turn that index into predictive risk signals.</li>
          <li>Critical thinking is essential: with short data horizons, results must be treated as upper bounds, not guarantees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For me, the main lesson is that the combination of macro signals and blockchain fundamentals is powerful. With better data availability,
          these methods could evolve into real-time tools for portfolio managers navigating the volatility of crypto markets.
