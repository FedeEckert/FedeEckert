           MORPHO
      ========================== -->
      <h2>Morpho: Architecture & Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Morpho’s mission is to make on-chain lending <strong>more capital-efficient</strong> while preserving the security model users already trust.
        It began as the <em>Morpho Optimizer</em>, a matching layer that sits on top of Aave/Compound, then evolved into <em>Morpho Blue</em> and
        <em>MetaMorpho (Vaults)</em> to deliver isolated-market safety with curated allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morpho set up to solve the problem of capital inefficiency in the classic pooled lending models like Aave or Compound. In such protocols,
        lenders earn the pool supply APY (often lower than what a matched borrower would pay), and borrowers pay the pool borrow APY (often higer 
        than what a matched lender would accept). In this way, the pool stays liquid and the protocol treasury makes profits on interest spread. 
        Morpho tries to solve this issue without compromising safety.
      </p>

    <h3>Morpho Optimizer (v1): Matching on top of Aave / Compound</h3>
      <p>
      The main idea is to leverage on Aave / Compound as the risk and settlement layer, but add a <strong>P2P engine</strong> on top. This framework results in 
      a considerable reduction of the interest spread, solving the capital allocation inefficiency problem. In particular, if a borrower wants to pay 5% and a lender is happy 
      recieving 3%, Morpho matches them at midpoint 4% (approximately). If a match is not available, positions sit in the pool at the usual rates, nobody could end up in a worse position than baseline.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Users only interact with Morpho contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk:</strong> The oracles, collateral, liquidations, and leverage risks still rely on Aave / Compound architecture. Matched positions are still fully secured by the underlying protocol</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This framework worked well because it meant a <strong>Pareto Improvement</strong> for every user, every user resulted in a better situation. Additionally, it was able to reduce 
        idle liquidity in the pools, as positions shifted toward matched pairs. However, this framework found some limitations. The main one being that matching users on top of a shared pool is stil
        constrained by pool parameters and risks, it inherited Aave / Compund. Morpho could not choose it's own LTV, the selection of assets that could be listed, the interest rate curves, and oracle system. 
        This limited the products and services that Morpho could offer, and that lead to <strong>Morpho Blue</strong>.
        
      </p>

    <h3>Morpho Blue (v2): Isolated Lending markets</h3>
      <p>
        In this iteration, Morpho tries to surpass some of the limitations previously mentioned and build its own market layer and lending infrastructure. Under this framework, each lending market would be isolated under its own capsule
        with its own specific parameters. 
     </p>
      <p>
        This means that every Morpho Blue market defines a set of parameters for each pair of assets:

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Collateral Asset:</strong> The token users post to borrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Loan Asset:</strong> The token users borrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Oracle:</strong> The specific price feed used for that pair.</li>
        <li><strong>LLTV (Liquidation Loan to Value):</strong> The maximum ratio of borrowed value to collateral value alloweds before liquidation.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidation module:</strong> Custom logic that defines how liquidations happen and what the penalty is.</li>  
        </ul>

        For example, the pair ETH-USDC has a different set of parameters and conditions than the pair stETH-DAI. In addition, Morpho Blue achieved its own interest rate model (Utilization curves 
        are directly coded in each Morpho Blue contract), liquidation logic, and risk framework.

        <h4>The power and limitations of Isolation</h4>
        <p>
        By isolating each pair into its own pool Morpho achieves a strong diversification of risks, a pool with a risky asset does not affect other pools at all. 
        For borrowers, this framework allos new forms of collateral as long as somebody launches a market for it, as there is no listing vote required. On the other hand, lenders are able to choose
        which risk they are willing to take (from exotic pairs to established and stable pairs). In this sense, Morpho Blue achieved a democratization of financial access to a wide range of tokens, without any limitation, 
        users can get credit or get a supply APY from a wide range of assets. 
        </p>
        <p>
        But this framework does not come without its limitations. Morpho Blue provided, in a sense, too much freedom, what can overwhelm the users. As 
        dozens of isolated markets are offered, lenders are required to research each blue market parameters and conditions in order to manage their funds. In this line, users are required to behave like porfolio managers, but most users do not want to 
        run a small credit fund every time they lend stablecoins. This friction explained the development of the next iteration: <strong>MetaMorpho</strong>.
        </p>

      <h3>MetaMorpho (Vaults): Vaults that allocate liquidity across Blue markets</h3>
      <p>
      The main idea behind the creation of MetaMorpho is to abstract risk management and allocation away from the end user. Before, the user needed to pick markets, study oracles and LLTVs, and allocate and rebalance the portfolio manually. MetaMorpho introduced the concept of <strong>Vaults</strong>, that does all fund management activities on the user's behalf in a transparent,
      permisionless way. We may undertsand this Vaults as a portfolio manager for Morpho Blue. 
      </p>
      <h4>How MetaMorpho works</h4>
      <p>
      MetaMorpho vaults has three main entities that define them and a few important properties:
        
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Sets fees, appoints curators/allocators, manages vault parameters. The owner is responsible of governance of the vault.</li>
        <li><strong>Curator:</strong> Defines which Morpho Blue markets the vault can use, adding and removing pairs as they see fit. Curators act as the "risk brain" of the vault, as users rely on them to define where the vault is allowd to deposit.</li>
        <li><strong>Allocator:</strong> Executes the allocation and rebalancing of funds across those blue markets. Allocators are the execution engine, good allocators extract more APY per unit of risk, while keeping liquidity for exit and respecting the curator guardrails</li>
        <li><strong>Timelocks:</strong> All critical parameter changes must wait a set period before taking effect.</li>
        <li><strong>ERC- 4626 standarization:</strong> Deposits issue shares that represent a pro-rata claim on the vault's assets.</li>  
      </ul>

      Taking these roles into account, the process would look like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1: Deposit & Shere issuance</strong>
        A lender deposits an asset, say USDC, into a MetaMorpho vault. The vault mints <em>shares</em> in return (Vault Shares = f(deposit ammount / total assets). These shares represent the lendder's claim to the vault's total holdings across all its Morpho Blue markets.
        
      </p>
      <p>
      <stong>Step 2: Allocation</stong>
        The allocator examines which eligible markets (defined by the curator) have:
        <ul>
        <li>Strond borrow demand: High utilization but healthy collateralization.</li>
        <li>Solid oracle and liquidation infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Sustainable interest rate spreads</li>
        </ul>

      It then distributes liquidity across those markets, for example, 60% in ETH/USDC, 25% in WBTC/USDC, 15% stETH/USDC. These allocations can be adjusted dynamically, but only within the pre-approved markets.
      </p>

  


      
    

        
      


      

      <h3>Vaults first: What they are and why they supply specific markets</h3>
      <p>
        Morpho vaults (MetaMorpho) are <strong>ERC-4626</strong> vaults that accept deposits (e.g., USDC) and allocate liquidity across a
        set of <strong>approved Morpho markets</strong>. Each vault declares:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Policy & risk perimeter:</strong> which markets are eligible (asset pairs, LLTV caps, oracle, liquidation params).</li>
        <li><strong>Roles & controls:</strong> <em>Owner</em> (fees/admin), <em>Curator</em> (enables/disables markets), <em>Allocator</em> (supply/withdraw scheduling).
            Parameter changes run through <strong>timelocks</strong>, letting depositors react.</li>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> maximize risk-adjusted APY by supplying markets with the best spread (borrow demand vs. supply rate) within policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="callout">
        Why supply those markets? Because isolated markets with strong borrow demand and robust risk parameters
        (oracle quality, liquidation efficiency, conservative LLTV) produce the most sustainable lender yield per unit of risk.
      </p>

      <h3>How allocation works (Mechanics)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Deposits mint vault shares (1 share = claim on proportional assets).</li>
        <li>Allocator supplies liquidity across approved Morpho markets; unmatched liquidity remains idle <em>inside the vault</em> or earns base yield if routed to an integrated pool (depending on the specific vault).</li>
        <li>Interest paid by borrowers accrues to suppliers; share price in asset terms increases.</li>
        <li>Withdrawals redeem shares for assets, subject to <strong>available liquidity</strong> in the markets the vault supplies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lending side: how Morpho makes it efficient</h3>
      <p>
        In the original Optimizer model (on Aave/Compound), Morpho would <strong>match lenders and borrowers P2P</strong> whenever possible.
        If a borrower is bidding 5% and a lender is offering at 3%, Morpho matches them near the midpoint (≈4%). Everyone wins:
        borrowers pay less than pool borrow APY, lenders earn more than pool supply APY—<em>without</em> changing the underlying risk, which
        still inherits Aave/Compound liquidations and collateral logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Morpho Blue, markets are <strong>natively isolated</strong> (pair + oracle + LLTV + liquidation params). Vaults then allocate across these markets,
        targeting the best spreads while respecting policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Borrower mechanics on Morpho</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Open position:</strong> post whitelisted collateral asset; borrow quote asset in that market.</li>
        <li><strong>Health & LLTV:</strong> each market sets a <em>loan-to-value cap</em> and liquidation threshold.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest formation:</strong> per-market interest curves (utilization-based) define supply/borrow rates; if matched P2P (in Optimizer), borrower rate improves.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidation:</strong> if health falls below threshold, keepers/liquidators repay debt and seize discounted collateral per market rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- =========================
           EULER
      ========================== -->
      <h2>Euler — Architecture & Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Euler’s mission is to make credit <strong>permissionless and modular</strong> while strictly <strong>isolating risk</strong>.
        Rather than one giant pool, Euler lets markets be created per asset pair with their own parameters. In V2 (EVK/EVC),
        vaults are the unit of credit and can be composed into a <em>credit graph</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>Vaults first: EVK vaults and why they supply markets</h3>
      <p>
        Euler V2 introduces the <strong>Euler Vault Kit (EVK)</strong> to deploy ERC-4626 lending vaults. There are two roles at the vault level:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Liability vaults:</strong> where lenders deposit and borrowers draw the asset.</li>
        <li><strong>Collateral vaults:</strong> assets posted as collateral to back borrows.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A liability vault explicitly <strong>whitelists</strong> which collateral vaults it accepts. Why supply these markets?
        Because the liability vault’s <em>interest curve</em>, <em>oracle choice</em>, and <em>collateral whitelist</em> together define a risk/return profile
        that can be tuned (conservative core markets vs. experimental long-tail). Vault creators compete on risk engineering.
      </p>

      <h3>How allocation works (Mechanics)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lenders deposit into a liability vault → receive vault shares.</li>
        <li>The vault accrues interest from borrowers; share value increases.</li>
        <li>Withdrawals depend on utilization: if most funds are lent, lenders may wait for repayments or pay an exit fee (if configured).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lending side: borrower mechanics on Euler</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deposit collateral</strong> into one or more collateral vaults (e.g., ETH).</li>
        <li><strong>Borrow</strong> from a liability vault that explicitly accepts your collateral vault(s).</li>
        <li><strong>Interest rate formation:</strong> smooth utilization-based curve, commonly parameterized as
            <span class="mono">r_b(U) = a + b·U^k</span> where <span class="mono">U</span> is utilization and <span class="mono">a,b,k</span> are curve parameters.
            This avoids hard “kinks” and reduces liquidity crunches under stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Health & liquidations:</strong> vault-level LTV & liquidation penalties; liquidators repay debt and seize collateral per vault config.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- =========================
           RISKS → WHY SUPPLY / WHY BORROW
      ========================== -->
      <h2>Why these vaults work (and what can break)</h2>
      <p class="callout">
        <strong>Why it works:</strong> Vaults aggregate passive liquidity behind clear policy. Curated (Morpho) or permissionless (Euler) market selection
        routes capital to where <em>borrow demand</em> and <em>risk controls</em> make the spread most sustainable.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rate modeling:</strong> utilization-based curves adjust smoothly to balance supply and demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk boundaries:</strong> Morpho Blue/Euler vaults isolate markets so a failure does not contaminate others.</li>
        <li><strong>Composability:</strong> ERC-4626 shares make deposits portable across DeFi, enabling secondary strategies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What can break:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Oracle/price risk:</strong> bad feeds or thin liquidations can cause bad debt.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity/withdraw risk:</strong> high utilization delays withdrawals until repayments arrive.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration risk:</strong> weak collateral whitelists (Euler) or risky market inclusion (Morpho) elevate lender risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational risk:</strong> allocator/curator error (Morpho) or poorly tuned interest curves (Euler).</li>
        <li><strong>Contract risk:</strong> standard smart-contract & governance risks.</li>
      </ul>
