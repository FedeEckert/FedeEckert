           MORPHO
      ========================== -->
      <h2>Morpho: Architecture & Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Morpho’s mission is to make on-chain lending <strong>more capital-efficient</strong> while preserving the security model users already trust.
        It began as the <em>Morpho Optimizer</em>, a matching layer that sits on top of Aave/Compound, then evolved into <em>Morpho Blue</em> and
        <em>MetaMorpho (Vaults)</em> to deliver isolated-market safety with curated allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morpho set up to solve the problem of capital inefficiency in the classic pooled lending models like Aave or Compound. In such protocols,
        lenders earn the pool supply APY (often lower than what a matched borrower would pay), and borrowers pay the pool borrow APY (often higer 
        than what a matched lender would accept). In this way, the pool stays liquid and the protocol treasury makes profits on interest spread. 
        Morpho tries to solve this issue without compromising safety.
      </p>

    <h3>Morpho Optimizer (v1): Matching on top of Aave / Compound</h3>
      <p>
      The main idea is to leverage on Aave / Compound as the risk and settlement layer, but add a <strong>P2P engine</strong> on top. This framework results in 
      a considerable reduction of the interest spread, solving the capital allocation inefficiency problem. In particular, if a borrower wants to pay 5% and a lender is happy 
      recieving 3%, Morpho matches them at midpoint 4% (approximately). If a match is not available, positions sit in the pool at the usual rates, nobody could end up in a worse position than baseline.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Users only interact with Morpho contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk:</strong> The oracles, collateral, liquidations, and leverage risks still rely on Aave / Compound architecture. Matched positions are still fully secured by the underlying protocol</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This framework worked well because it meant a <strong>Pareto Improvement</strong> for every user, every user resulted in a better situation. Additionally, it was able to reduce 
        idle liquidity in the pools, as positions shifted toward matched pairs. However, this framework found some limitations. The main one being that matching users on top of a shared pool is stil
        constrained by pool parameters and risks, it inherited Aave / Compund. Morpho could not choose it's own LTV, the selection of assets that could be listed, the interest rate curves, and oracle system. 
        This limited the products and services that Morpho could offer, and that lead to <strong>Morpho Blue</strong>.
        
      </p>

    <h3>Morpho Blue (v2): Isolated Lending markets</h3>
      <p>
        In this iteration, Morpho tries to surpass some of the limitations previously mentioned and build its own market layer and lending infrastructure. Under this framework, each lending market would be isolated under its own capsule
        with its own specific parameters. 
     </p>
      <p>
        This means that every Morpho Blue market defines a set of parameters for each pair of assets:

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Collateral Asset:</strong> The token users post to borrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Loan Asset:</strong> The token users borrow.</li>
        <li><strong>Oracle:</strong> The specific price feed used for that pair.</li>
        <li><strong>LLTV (Liquidation Loan to Value):</strong> The maximum ratio of borrowed value to collateral value alloweds before liquidation.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidation module:</strong> Custom logic that defines how liquidations happen and what the penalty is.</li>  
        </ul>

        For example, the pair ETH-USDC has a different set of parameters and conditions than the pair stETH-DAI. In addition, Morpho Blue achieved its own interest rate model (Utilization curves 
        are directly coded in each Morpho Blue contract), liquidation logic, and risk framework.

        <h4>The power and limitations of Isolation</h4>
        <p>
        By isolating each pair into its own pool Morpho achieves a strong diversification of risks, a pool with a risky asset does not affect other pools at all. 
        For borrowers, this framework allos new forms of collateral as long as somebody launches a market for it, as there is no listing vote required. On the other hand, lenders are able to choose
        which risk they are willing to take (from exotic pairs to established and stable pairs). In this sense, Morpho Blue achieved a democratization of financial access to a wide range of tokens, without any limitation, 
        users can get credit or get a supply APY from a wide range of assets. 
        </p>
        <p>
        But this framework does not come without its limitations. Morpho Blue provided, in a sense, too much freedom, what can overwhelm the users. As 
        dozens of isolated markets are offered, lenders are required to research each blue market parameters and conditions in order to manage their funds. In this line, users are required to behave like porfolio managers, but most users do not want to 
        run a small credit fund every time they lend stablecoins. This friction explained the development of the next iteration: <strong>MetaMorpho</strong>.
        </p>

      <h3>MetaMorpho (Vaults): Vaults that allocate liquidity across Blue markets</h3>
      <p>
      The main idea behind the creation of MetaMorpho is to abstract risk management and allocation away from the end user. Before, the user needed to pick markets, study oracles and LLTVs, and allocate and rebalance the portfolio manually. MetaMorpho introduced the concept of <strong>Vaults</strong>, that does all fund management activities on the user's behalf in a transparent,
      permisionless way. We may undertsand this Vaults as a portfolio manager for Morpho Blue. 
      </p>
      <h4>How MetaMorpho works</h4>
      <p>
      MetaMorpho vaults has three main entities that define them and a few important properties:
        
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Sets fees, appoints curators/allocators, manages vault parameters. The owner is responsible of governance of the vault.</li>
        <li><strong>Curator:</strong> Defines which Morpho Blue markets the vault can use, adding and removing pairs as they see fit. Curators act as the "risk brain" of the vault, as users rely on them to define where the vault is allowd to deposit.</li>
        <li><strong>Allocator:</strong> Executes the allocation and rebalancing of funds across those blue markets. Allocators are the execution engine, good allocators extract more APY per unit of risk, while keeping liquidity for exit and respecting the curator guardrails</li>
        <li><strong>Timelocks:</strong> All critical parameter changes must wait a set period before taking effect.</li>
        <li><strong>ERC- 4626 standarization:</strong> Deposits issue shares that represent a pro-rata claim on the vault's assets.</li>  
      </ul>

      Taking these roles into account, the process would look like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1: Deposit & Shere issuance</strong>
        A lender deposits an asset, say USDC, into a MetaMorpho vault. The vault mints <em>shares</em> in return (Vault Shares = f(deposit ammount / total assets). These shares represent the lendder's claim to the vault's total holdings across all its Morpho Blue markets.
        
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Step 2: Allocation</strong>
        The allocator examines which eligible markets (defined by the curator) have:
        <ul>
        <li>Strond borrow demand: High utilization but healthy collateralization.</li>
        <li>Solid oracle and liquidation infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Sustainable interest rate spreads</li>
        </ul>

      It then distributes liquidity across those markets, for example, 60% in ETH/USDC, 25% in WBTC/USDC, 15% stETH/USDC. These allocations can be adjusted dynamically, but only within the pre-approved markets.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Step 3: Interest Accrual</strong>
      Borrowers in those underlying markets pay interest into the Morpho Blue contracts. Each market keeps track of the <em>Total supplied liquidity</em>, <em>Total Borrowed liquidity</em>, <em>Utilization rate</em> that drives interest-rate curve.
      the vaults share of each market' lender income aggregates into its total holdings. As this income accumulates, the vault's share price (assets per share) increases, and that's how yield reaches depositors.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Step 4: Withdrawal</strong>
        When a user withdraws, the vauls burns their shares and return assets. If there is a high utilization (tight liquidity), the allocator has an order to unwind positions. 
      </p>

      <h4>Why is this system powerful</h4>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Lenders no longer need to manually select markets ot manage allocations, they can deposit into a vault with a well known curator and a clear policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegated risk management:</strong> Curators can be professional risk assessors (Gaunlet, Chaos Labs or other DAOs). Users choose who to trust based on the vaults's transparency and past performance. All risk changes are <em>timelocked</em>, so users always have time to exit before exposure changes</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity aggregation:</strong> Vaults concentrate liquidity across the most active markets, improving depth and reducing fragmentation. As a result, rates become more stable without reintroducing risk contagion</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency and permissionlessness:</strong> All vault actions, roles, and allocations are visible on-chain. Anyone can deploy their own vault, with their own policy, under the same ERC-4626 standard.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

  <p>
    Today, Morpho functions not just as a niche optimizer but as a full-stack lending infrastructure. The original Optimizer products are now deprecated (with front-end support ending in September 2025). Morpho Blue sits at the core of this stack: TVL stands around US $3.9 billion 
    (as of mid-2025, up ~38% year-to-date) and the protocol supports hundreds of isolated markets. Layered on top of that, MetaMorpho vaults aggregate liquidity and simplify access for lenders, enabling capital deployment across curated risk-perimeters while leveraging Blue’s modular 
    architecture. The result: markets where lenders earn better rates, borrowers access bespoke collateral/borrow pairs, and risks are compartmentalised per-market. In short, Morpho today delivers both accessibility and infrastructure-grade flexibility, placing it squarely among the most 
    relevant protocols powering on-chain credit markets.
