        <h1>Decentralized Lending: The Problem of Over-Collateralization</h1>
        <p class="section-lead">DeFi promised open access to finance, but its reliance on extreme collateral requirements threatens both inclusion and efficiency.</p>

        <h2>The Promise of DeFi</h2>
        <p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as one of the most disruptive forces in financial services. Protocols like AAVE, Compound, and MakerDAO allow users to lend and borrow crypto-assets in a transparent, non-custodial environment. By replacing intermediaries with smart contracts, DeFi promised to democratize access to credit and investment opportunities worldwide.</p>

        <h2>The Collateral Trap</h2>
        <p>Yet despite its openness, DeFi lending is built almost entirely on <strong>overcollateralization</strong>. To borrow $100, a user typically needs to lock up $150–200 in collateral. While this design effectively mitigates default risk, it introduces a structural flaw: only those who already have significant assets can access credit. For people with limited savings or income—precisely those who most need credit—this model is exclusionary.</p>
        <p>The scale of the problem is global. According to the <em>World Bank’s Global Findex Database (2021)</em>, 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked, lacking access to formal financial services including credit. For these individuals, credit is not just about consumption—it is often the key to investing in education, health, or entrepreneurial activity.</p>

        <h2>Why DeFi Relies on Over-Collateralization</h2>
        <p>This reliance is not arbitrary. It arises from two fundamental constraints in DeFi:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Information asymmetry:</strong> Unlike banks, DeFi protocols cannot verify income statements, employment history, or repayment behavior. Borrowers appear only as pseudonymous wallet addresses, leaving smart contracts with no way to assess intent or ability to repay. The only reliable signal available is the collateral deposited on-chain.</li>
          <li><strong>Volatility of crypto assets:</strong> Prices fluctuate sharply. To protect lenders, protocols enforce automatic liquidations when collateral value falls below a threshold. This rigid mechanism ensures solvency but forces borrowers to maintain a wide safety buffer, further limiting how much they can borrow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Cost of Safety</h2>
        <p>Research from the <em>Bank for International Settlements (2023)</em> shows that even though protocols theoretically allow users to borrow up to 70–80% of collateral value, borrowers rarely approach these limits. Instead, most maintain leverage ratios between 1.4 and 1.9, well below the maximum. The reason is simple: even small market dips can trigger liquidations, leading to capital loss and reinforcing systemic fragility.</p>
        <p>This creates a paradox. DeFi offers permissionless access to credit, but in practice only benefits those with substantial crypto holdings who can afford to lock up capital inefficiently. The very users most in need of credit—those with stable income, responsible financial behavior, but limited assets—are shut out.</p>

        <h2>The Broader Implications</h2>
        <p>The structural dependence on overcollateralization reveals a critical limitation in today’s DeFi: its inability to extend credit to users without significant crypto wealth. This hampers financial inclusion and restricts the role DeFi can play in fostering economic development. Unless DeFi finds ways to assess creditworthiness beyond collateral, its promise of open finance risks remaining an illusion.</p>
