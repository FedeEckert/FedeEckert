      <h1>USDC Lending Strategy & Stress testing across DeFi markets</h1>

      <p class="section-lead">
        How to design an optimal USDC lending allocation in DeFi by defining an investable universe,
        building a risk framework, constructing an objective function, and stress testing the
        resulting allocation under adverse market conditions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Allocating stablecoin liquidity in decentralized finance is often approached as a yield
        maximization problem. Capital flows toward the highest advertised APR, implicitly assuming
        that all lending venues offering the same asset are comparable. In reality, lending USDC
        across DeFi markets exposes liquidity providers to materially different risk profiles,
        liquidity constraints, and tail risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The objective of this post is to design and explain a systematic strategy for allocating
        USDC liquidity across DeFi lending markets in an optimal way. Rather than starting from
        returns, the approach builds an allocation engine from first principles: defining a
        constrained universe of opportunities, transforming that universe through a risk framework,
        and constructing a decision function capable of selecting an optimal allocation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a baseline allocation is obtained, the framework is extended to analyze how the
        allocation behaves under stress. Two distinct classes of adverse scenarios are considered:
        solvency-related events, where markets struggle to absorb losses, and liquidity-related
        events, where capital cannot be efficiently withdrawn or redeployed. This allows the
        strategy to be evaluated not only in normal conditions, but also under extreme market
        dynamics.
      </p>

      <p>
        All results are based on a snapshot of DeFi markets observed on November 21st, focusing on
        the most liquid chains and institutional-grade lending venues. While the inputs are static,
        the framework is intentionally modular and designed to highlight the modeling choices,
        assumptions, and trade-offs involved in real-world liquidity allocation decisions.
