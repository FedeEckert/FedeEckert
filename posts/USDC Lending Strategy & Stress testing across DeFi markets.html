        How to design an optimal USDC lending allocation in DeFi by defining an investable universe,
        building a risk framework, constructing an objective function, and stress testing the
        resulting allocation under adverse market conditions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        The task addressed in this post is the construction of an optimal USDC lending allocation across different DeFi markets. 
        Although the asset being deployed is the same, lending venues differ materially in their collateral structures, 
        liquidation mechanics, liquidity profiles, and failure modes. The objective of this post is to design and explain a 
        systematic strategy for allocating USDC liquidity across DeFi lending markets in an optimal way. Rather than starting from
        returns, the approach builds an allocation engine from first principles: defining a
        constrained universe of opportunities, transforming that universe through a risk framework,
        and constructing a decision function capable of selecting an optimal allocation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a baseline allocation is obtained, the framework is extended to analyze how the
        allocation behaves under stress. Two distinct classes of adverse scenarios are considered:
        the first one is a collateraql price drawdown, and the second one is a major systemic panic, replicating a shock like the LUNA crash or the FTX event.
        From this we would see how the model reacts to such adverse scenarios and how allocation changes. 
      </p>

      <p>
        All results are based on a snapshot of DeFi markets observed on November 21st, focusing on
        the most liquid chains and institutional-grade lending venues. An important assumption from the model is that there are no frictions when unwinding a position, there are no issues in reallocating the portfolio. this assumption was introduced to focus on the reallocation decisions. While the inputs are static,
        the framework is intentionally modular and designed to highlight the modeling choices,
        assumptions, and trade-offs involved in real-world liquidity allocation decisions.
