        <h1>Euler: Modular Credit Infrastructure for DeFi</h1>
        <p class="section-lead">
          Euler V2 turns lending into a modular, permissionless system of isolated credit vaults.
          Below I explain the motivation, how it works (EVK + EVC), how interest rates are modeled, why it differs from Morpho,
          and why it matters—backed by live usage metrics.

        <h2>The problem Euler set out to solve</h2>
        <p>
          DeFi lending protocols like Aave or Compound pioneered in open borrowing and lending. They pooled deposits from lenders and issued loans to borrowers within the same shared liquidity pool.
          While this design is very innovative and revolutionary, it is also quite limited:

          <ol>
          <li><strong>Shared Risk:</strong> All assets share a common pool of liquidity, so if one risky asset collapses, it can trigger liquidations or bad debt across the entire ecosystem. Also, one single exploit or oracle failure can edanger every depositor.</li>
          <li><strong>Listing rigidity:</strong> In order to protect the pool, governance only approves the listing of of the most liquid, blue-chip assets (stablecoins, ETH, wBTC). As a result, innovative or long tail tokens are excluded.</li>
          <li><strong>Uniform parameters</strong> Global interest rate models, liquidation penalties, and LTV ratios apply to all markets. While this works, it misprices risk.</li>
          </ol>
          
          Inspired in this, <strong>Euler</strong> was built. The main goal was to allow anyone to create a lending market safely, without relying on global governance and without endangering others. Euler reimagines a lending protocol not as one giant pool, but as a <em>network of vauls</em>, 
          each with its own logic, parameters, and risk perimeter. 
        </p>

        <h2>Architecture: How Euler works</h2>

        <h3>EVK (Euler Vault Kit)</h3>
        
        <p>
        The EVK is the smart contract toolkit that developers use to create vaults. A vault is a self contained ERC-4626 contract that can handle deposits, borrowing and interest accrual. Each Vault defines:
          
        <ol>
          <li>The asset it lends and holds</li>
          <li>The oracle it uses for price data</li>
          <li>The interest rate model</li>
          <li>The liquidation logic and penalty</li>
          <li>The LTV or LLTV ratio</li>
          <li><strong>The collateral vaults it accepts</strong></li>
          </ol>

        This is a crucial distinction of Euler's design, as not all assets that can be deposited into vaults as liquidity are then accepted as collateral for loans. Each <em>liability vault</em> (the one holding the lendable asset) decides which <em>collateral vaults</em> are accepted to back up loans.
        Each liability vault's whitelist of acceptable collateral vaults is called its <em>collateral map</em>. In this manner, Euler is able to allow the creation of any vault without restrictions while keeping risk contained into each vault, and ss a result, you get mani "mini markets", each isolated and parametrized individually.
        </p>
        <h3>EVC (Ethereum Vault Connector)</h3>

        <p>
        Even though having many vaults is a powerful concepts, it is not of much use for users unless there is a way to connect them all. That is the job of the EVC, it acts as the orchestation layer that enables composability without losing isolation. The EVC allows to batch actions across vaults in one transaction (deposit collatera, borrow, repay, withdraw), 
        use subaccounts and manage multiple position automatically, and also enforce "end of all transactions" across all vaults you interacted with. So as vaults are isolated at a smart contract level, the EVC makes the system behave as one inegrated network for users, what Euler calls the <strong>credit graph</strong>.
        </p>


        <h2>How Lending and Borrowing work</h2>

        <h3>Lender Perspective</h3>
        <div>
         <ol>
         <li><strong>(1)</strong> You deposit USDC into the <em>USDC liability vault</em></li>
         <li><strong>(2)</strong> Borrowers draw USDC and pay interest over time.</li>
         <li><strong>(3)</strong> The vault's internal "total asets" grow, so your shares increase in value <strong>-This is the Yield-</strong>.</li>
         <li><strong>(4)</strong> You can withdraw anytime if there is enough liquidity; when utilization is high, withdrawals may take time</li>
         </ol>
      </div>
        
      <h3>Borrower Perspective</h3>

        <div>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>(1)</strong> You deposit <em>ETH</em> into the <em>ETH collateral vault</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>(2)</strong> You borrow <em>USDC</em> from a <em>USDC liability vault</em> that whitelists the ETH collateral vault.</li>
    <li><strong>(3)</strong> Your borrowing capacity is defined by the vault’s LLTV:<br>
      <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace; background:rgba(2,6,23,0.04); padding:4px 6px; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-top:4px;">
        Borrow&nbsp;limit&nbsp;=&nbsp;Collateral&nbsp;value&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;LLTV
      </span>
    </li>
    <li><strong>(4)</strong> Your health factor is:<br>
      <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace; background:rgba(2,6,23,0.04); padding:4px 6px; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-top:4px;">
        Health&nbsp;=&nbsp;(Collateral&nbsp;value&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;LLTV)&nbsp;/&nbsp;Borrowed&nbsp;value
      </span><br>
      If <strong>Health&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1</strong>, liquidation can occur.
    </li>
    <li><strong>(5)</strong> Liquidators repay your debt and seize your collateral at a discount.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
        <p>
        This is the same logic that is used in lending protocols like Aave or Compound, but in Euler it is isolated per vault, not shared globally.
          
        </p>

        <h3>The interest rate model</h3>
        <p>
        Most protocols (Aave, Compound, Morpho Blue) use a two-segment kink model, where below certain kink the interest rate responds smoothly to changes in utilization. But if utilization reaches or surpases a certain kink, the interest rate responds sharply in order to prevent liquidity exhaustion. Euler 
        insight is that different assets need different shapes of rate responses. 
        </p>

        <h4>Euler's smooth power curve</h4>
        
<p>
  Euler generalizes the relationship between utilization and rates with:
</p>

<p style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace; background:rgba(2,6,23,0.04); padding:6px 8px; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block;">
  r<sub>b</sub>(U) = a + b &middot; U<sup>k</sup>
</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>U</strong> = Borrowed&nbsp;/&nbsp;Supplied</li>
  <li><strong>r<sub>b</sub></strong> = borrow&nbsp;APR</li>
  <li><strong>a</strong> = base&nbsp;rate&nbsp;(minimum&nbsp;APR)</li>
  <li><strong>b</strong> = slope&nbsp;factor&nbsp;(how&nbsp;aggressively&nbsp;rates&nbsp;rise)</li>
  <li><strong>k</strong> = curve&nbsp;exponent&nbsp;(controls&nbsp;convexity)</li>
</ul>

<p>How it behaves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When utilization is low (U small):&nbsp;
    <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">r<sub>b</sub> &asymp; a, so the borrow rate will be similar to the base rate, trying to incentivize borrowing.</span>
  </li>
  <li>Under this model rates react smoothly to increases in utilization (no abrupt “kink”).</li>
  <li><strong>k</strong> controls steepness so each vault has a different interest rate model that adapts best to its characteristics:
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">k &asymp; 1</span> → almost linear, gentle, ideal for stablecoin markets.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">k &gt; 2</span> → convex, sharply increasing, ideal for volatile or thin markets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In this manner, each vault defines its own <em>Interest Rate Model</em> (IRM), every market can price liquidity risk independently, what gives Euler the mathematical flexibility other protocols lack.
</p>
        <h4>Supply Rate and Spread</h4>
<p>Given a reserve factor <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">r<sub>f</sub></span>, the lender’s supply APR is:</p>

<p style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace; background:rgba(2,6,23,0.04); padding:6px 8px; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block;">
  r<sub>s</sub>(U) = (1 &minus; r<sub>f</sub>) &middot; U &middot; r<sub>b</sub>(U)
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">U = borrowed / supplied</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">r<sub>b</sub>(U)</span> is the borrow APR determined by the vault’s IRM</li>
  <li><span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">r<sub>f</sub></span> is the protocol reserve factor (fee skim)</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this way, if utilization is low and little is borrowed, suppliers earn less, even if <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">r<sub>b</sub>(U)</span> is high. Also, if <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">r<sub>f</sub></span> increases, 
suppliers earn less as more goes to protocol reserves. Finally, when <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace;">r<sub>b</sub>(U)</span> rises, suppliers' APR can rise accordingly, but always tempered by utilization and the reserve factor.
  
</p>

        <h2>How is Euler different from Morpho</h2>
        <p>
          An important claryfying concept is how is Euler's value proposition different from other vuault provider protocols, in particular, from MetaMorpho, other giant in the DeFi vault sapce.
        <p>
          Euler’s framework is about decentralization, modularity, and permissionless design. It gives anyone the tools to build a lending market from scratch. Through its Vault Kit, a developer or DAO can deploy an isolated vault with custom parameters: its own oracle, loan-to-value ratio, liquidation logic, and interest-rate curve. Each vault behaves as a self-contained system: 
          if one fails, it does not threaten the others. This modular isolation makes Euler more like <em>infrastructure than a user product</em>. It’s a foundational layer that others can build upon, a kind of AWS for credit markets, where the protocol provides the primitives and governance sets the rules, but users decide what to build. The value proposition is freedom and safety. 
          Euler empowers builders to create new credit markets, test novel risk models, or issue asset-backed loans: all without introducing contagion risk to existing markets.
       </p>
        <p>
          Morpho’s framework, by contrast, is focused on efficiency and accessibility. It started by optimizing lending rates on Aave and Compound (the Optimizer) and later evolved into Morpho Blue, its own isolated-market protocol. Today, Morpho’s flagship product is MetaMorpho, a curated vault system that aggregates capital and distributes it across vetted markets.
          Instead of letting anyone spin up markets freely, Morpho takes a selective and managed approach. Professional curators choose which markets fall inside each vault’s risk perimeter and allocators decide how deposits are distributed. Users can simply deposit into a vault and earn yield without analyzing parameters, utilization, or oracles themselves. The value proposition here is 
          simplicity and trust. Morpho focuses on offering competitive yields and safe exposure through professional risk management, appealing to users who prefer curation over customization.
        </p>

        <h2>Where does Euler sit in the DeFi space</h2>

        <p>
        As of Q4 2025, Euler V2 manages roughly $3.3B in TVL, with around $1.6B in active borrows, and generates over $130M in annualized interest revenue. Its modular design supports dozens of vaults across major assets (ETH, WBTC, wstETH, crvUSD, stables), and a growing number of custom deployments by DAOs and funds.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, Euler's importance in DEFi goes beyond the numbers, Euler is the platformed that allows the entire ecosystem to scale and grow safely, without the risk of centralization and contagion. It also brings to the space the freedom of permissionlessly create any market you misght see a need for, without any governance bottleneck. In conclusion, Euler's framework is genious becaus it allowed DeFi to scale safely without ever compromising the fundamental values of the ecosystem.
