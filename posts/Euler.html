        <h1>Euler: Modular Credit Infrastructure for DeFi</h1>
        <p class="section-lead">
          Euler V2 turns lending into a modular, permissionless system of isolated credit vaults.
          Below I explain the motivation, how it works (EVK + EVC), how interest rates are modeled, why it differs from Morpho,
          and why it matters—backed by live usage metrics.

        <h2>The problem Euler set out to solve</h2>
        <p>
          DeFi lending protocols like Aave or Compound pioneered in open borrowing and lending. They pooled deposits from lenders and issued loans to borrowers within the same shared liquidity pool.
          While this design is very innovative and revolutionary, it is also quite limited:

          <ol>
          <li><strong>Shared Risk:</strong> All assets share a common pool of liquidity, so if one risky asset collapses, it can trigger liquidations or bad debt across the entire ecosystem. Also, one single exploit or oracle failure can edanger every depositor.</li>
          <li><strong>Listing rigidity:</strong> In order to protect the pool, governance only approves the listing of of the most liquid, blue-chip assets (stablecoins, ETH, wBTC). As a result, innovative or long tail tokens are excluded.</li>
          <li><strong>Uniform parameters</strong> Global interest rate models, liquidation penalties, and LTV ratios apply to all markets. While this works, it misprices risk.</li>
          </ol>
          
          Inspired in this, <strong>Euler</strong> was built. The main goal was to allow anyone to create a lending market safely, without relying on global governance and without endangering others. Euler reimagines a lending protocol not as one giant pool, but as a <em>network of vauls</em>, 
          each with its own logic, parameters, and risk perimeter. 
        </p>

        <h2>Architecture: How Euler works</h2>

        <h3>EVK (Euler Vault Kit)</h3>
        
        <p>
        The EVK is the smart contract toolkit that developers use to create vaults. A vault is a self contained ERC-4626 contract that can handle deposits, borrowing and interest accrual. Each Vault defines:
          
        <ol>
          <li>The asset it lends and holds</li>
          <li>The oracle it uses for price data</li>
          <li>The interest rate model</li>
          <li>The liquidation logic and penalty</li>
          <li>The LTV or LLTV ratio</li>
          <li><strong>The collateral vaults it accepts</strong></li>
          </ol>

        This is a crucial distinction of Euler's design, as not all assets that can be deposited into vaults as liquidity are then accepted as collateral for loans. Each <em>liability vault</em> (the one holding the lendable asset) decides which <em>collateral vaults</em> are accepted to back up loans.
        Each liability vault's whitelist of acceptable collateral vaults is called its <em>collateral map</em>. In this manner, Euler is able to allow the creation of any vault without restrictions while keeping risk contained into each vault, and ss a result, you get mani "mini markets", each isolated and parametrized individually.
        </p>
        <h3>EVC (Ethereum Vault Connector)</h3>

        <p>
        Even though having many vaults is a powerful concepts, it is not of much use for users unless there is a way to connect them all. That is the job of the EVC, it acts as the orchestation layer that enables composability without losing isolation. The EVC allows to batch actions across vaults in one transaction (deposit collatera, borrow, repay, withdraw), 
        use subaccounts and manage multiple position automatically, and also enforce "end of all transactions" across all vaults you interacted with. So as vaults are isolated at a smart contract level, the EVC makes the system behave as one inegrated network for users, what Euler calls the <strong>credit graph</strong>.
        </p>


        <h2>How Lending and Borrowing work</h2>

        <h3>Lender Perspective</h3>
        <div>
         <ol>
         <li><strong>(1)</strong> You deposit USDC into the <em>USDC liability vault</em></li>
         <li><strong>(2)</strong> Borrowers draw USDC and pay interest over time.</li>
         <li><strong>(3)</strong> The vault's internal "total asets" grow, so your shares increase in value <strong>-This is the Yield-</strong>.</li>
         <li><strong>(4)</strong> You can withdraw anytime if there is enough liquidity; when utilization is high, withdrawals may take time</li>
         </ol>
      </div>
        
      <h3>Borrower Perspective</h3>

        <div>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>(1)</strong> You deposit <em>ETH</em> into the <em>ETH collateral vault</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>(2)</strong> You borrow <em>USDC</em> from a <em>USDC liability vault</em> that whitelists the ETH collateral vault.</li>
    <li><strong>(3)</strong> Your borrowing capacity is defined by the vault’s LLTV:<br>
      <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace; background:rgba(2,6,23,0.04); padding:4px 6px; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-top:4px;">
        Borrow&nbsp;limit&nbsp;=&nbsp;Collateral&nbsp;value&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;LLTV
      </span>
    </li>
    <li><strong>(4)</strong> Your health factor is:<br>
      <span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono',monospace; background:rgba(2,6,23,0.04); padding:4px 6px; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-top:4px;">
        Health&nbsp;=&nbsp;(Collateral&nbsp;value&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;LLTV)&nbsp;/&nbsp;Borrowed&nbsp;value
      </span><br>
      If <strong>Health&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1</strong>, liquidation can occur.
    </li>
    <li><strong>(5)</strong> Liquidators repay your debt and seize your collateral at a discount.</li>
  </ol>
</div>







        
        
        <h3>EVK: Euler Vault Kit (vaults as isolated lending pools)</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Euler Vault Kit (EVK)</strong> lets anyone deploy a lending vault that follows ERC-4626 share accounting but adds borrowing.
          Conceptually, there are two kinds of vaults: a <strong>liability vault</strong> (where lenders deposit the asset that can be borrowed)
          and <strong>collateral vaults</strong> (where users park assets that can be recognized as collateral by specific liability vaults).
          Crucially, each liability vault picks which collateral vaults it accepts—so risk is isolated per vault.
        </p>

        <h3>EVC: Ethereum Vault Connector (orchestrating multi-vault positions)</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>EVC</strong> is the router/entry point that stitches vaults together: it enables batching of actions, sub-accounts,
          and cross-vault checks, so a user can (in one call) deposit collateral in vault X and borrow from vault Y with health checks at the end.
          This is what turns a set of isolated vaults into a flexible <em>credit graph</em>.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          Security note: both EVK and EVC have undergone third-party audits (OpenZeppelin, ChainSecurity), and Euler runs a large bug bounty program
          for core components.
        </p>

        <h2>Interest-rate models — how pricing adapts to utilisation</h2>
        <p>
          Euler V2 supports multiple <strong>Interest Rate Models (IRM)</strong> at the vault level. A common design is a
          <strong>linear-kink</strong> curve (gradual increase until a utilisation threshold, then a steeper slope), but other reactive models are available.
          The key idea is that <em>each vault</em> can select a curve appropriate to its asset/liquidity profile, rather than sharing one global model.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intuition is standard: let <span class="mono">U = borrowed / supplied</span>. As <span class="mono">U</span> rises, borrow rates increase to attract supply
          and temper demand; as <span class="mono">U</span> falls, rates ease. Where allowed, a smooth model of the form
          <span class="mono">r<sub>b</sub>(U) = a + b·Uⁿ</span> can be configured to avoid hard shocks; for stable pairs one might use a gentler slope (n≈1),
          while volatile assets can use steeper curves.
        </p>

        <h2>User flows — lender and borrower, step by step</h2>
        <h3>Lender (liability vault)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Deposit</strong> the asset into a liability vault → receive ERC-4626 shares.</li>
          <li><strong>Accrue</strong> yield as borrowers draw and pay interest; assets-per-share increases.</li>
          <li><strong>Withdraw</strong> when liquidity allows (utilisation affects exit smoothness).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Many integrators route through EVC for batching and portfolio operations.</p>

        <h3>Borrower (via EVC)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Post collateral</strong> into one or more collateral vaults.</li>
          <li><strong>Borrow</strong> from a liability vault that <em>whitelists</em> those collateral vaults.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain health</strong>; liquidations are handled per-vault (oracle, LTV, penalty) if the position falls below thresholds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because each liability vault decides its accepted collateral map, risk is constrained <em>by design</em>.</p>

        <h2>How Euler differs from Morpho</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Market creation vs. curation:</strong> Euler’s EVK/EVC enables <em>permissionless</em> vault creation and arbitrary credit graphs; Morpho enfatiza listas de mercados <em>curadas</em> y vaults con asignadores (MetaMorpho) sobre sus mercados aislados Blue.</li>
          <li><strong>Dónde vive el riesgo:</strong> Euler aísla el riesgo a nivel <em>vault</em> (cada liability vault define su mapa de colateral); Morpho aísla a nivel <em>market</em> (par) y luego agrega vía vaults que whitelistean markets.</li>
          <li><strong>Modelos de tasa:</strong> Euler expone múltiples IRMs por vault (incluyendo linear-kink y modelos reactivos); Morpho pasó de optimización P2P (Optimizer) a asignación vía vaults sobre Blue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risks and what to monitor</h2>
        <ul class="kpi">
          <li><strong>Oracle & liquidation efficacy</strong> (per vault): mispriced oracles or thin auctions can create bad debt—revisar oráculo y mecánica de penalidad.</li>
          <li><strong>Utilisation & exit liquidity:</strong> U alto puede demorar retiros; seguir U y la pendiente del IRM.</li>
          <li><strong>Collateral map changes:</strong> liability vaults pueden actualizar colaterales aceptados; mirar governance, changelogs y alcance del bounty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Closing — why Euler matters (with current stats)</h2>
        <p>
          As of <strong>31 Oct 2025</strong>, <em>Euler V2</em> is securing roughly <strong>$3.26&nbsp;billion TVL</strong> with <strong>$1.63&nbsp;billion borrowed</strong>,
          and an annualized fee run-rate around <strong>$137&nbsp;million</strong> según DefiLlama. Under the hood, the combination of <strong>EVK</strong>
          (to spin up isolated, configurable vaults) and the <strong>EVC</strong> (to compose them safely with batching and account controls)
          makes Euler less a single app and more a <em>credit infrastructure layer</em> for DeFi.
